# Real-Time Face Mask Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in real-time using a deep learning model. The system captures a live video stream, identifies faces, and analyzes them for the presence of face masks. The implementation is built using Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras.
